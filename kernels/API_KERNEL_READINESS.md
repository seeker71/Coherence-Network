## What's eligible for the flip, and what stays CPython

The flip is for the **pure-computation core** of an endpoint, not the whole
stack. FastAPI stays the doorway.

| Layer | Kernel-bmf eligible? | Why |
|-------|----------------------|-----|
| Pure numeric/structural computation (the `endpoint_*_demo.py` shapes) | **Yes** | Deterministic, integer/float/list in → value out. This is what a Form recipe carries today. |
| HTTP routing, path/query binding | No | FastAPI's job — the doorway. |
| Pydantic request/response validation | No | Schema validation lives in the framework; the kernel returns a scalar/list the response model wraps. |
| Async I/O, concurrency | No | The kernel is a synchronous evaluator; async orchestration stays in the host. |
| DB / Neo4j / Postgres calls, network | No | Side-effecting I/O, not pure computation. Carriers (substrate ports) are a separate arc, not this flip. |

So the readiness question is **only** about the computational core of the four
already-transmuted endpoints in
[`api/app/routers/utils.py`](../api/app/routers/utils.py):
`coherence_weight`, `nodeid_distance`, `nodeid_compatibility`, `weighted_average`.

## How the live endpoint dispatches to the kernel (the real capture target)

The endpoints call `serve_via_kernel` in
[`api/app/services/form_kernel_bridge.py`](../api/app/services/form_kernel_bridge.py).
Per request it:

1. `load_recipe(endpoint_X.fk)` — loads a `.fk` **pre-compiled at deploy time**
   (the deploy pipeline runs `npx tsx src/main.ts python-compile X.py X.fk`
   once; the `.fk` is **not** committed and is **absent in a fresh worktree** —
   the harness compiles it to stand in for the deploy artifact).
2. `inject_bindings(...)` — rewrites the `(let ...)` input literals in-process (µs).
3. **The dispatch fork**, fastest path available:
   - `inline` — the `form_kernel_rust` PyO3 extension, a C call into Rust, no
     spawn. **Built and measured in this worktree (2026-06-01)** via
     `maturin develop --release` into the API venv; the hot path the
     persistent-serve evidence pointed at. The deploy image still needs the
     build step (named below).
   - `subprocess` — fork+exec the `form-kernel-rust` binary on a temp `.fk`.
     **This is the path that serves today** wherever the binary is present.
   - `python-fallback` — the inline-CPython twin, when no kernel is reachable.

There is a second, much heavier path that the "API code → Form-native, no
Python in the path" dream implies: `form/scripts/pyfkb-run.sh --kernel rust`
(**PATH B**), which source-compiles ~10 BML preludes and runs the whole
python-bmf scanner/grammar/eval pipeline over raw `.py` bytes every call. That
is a **parity-proof** path, not a serving path — measured below to show why.

## Measured profile (2026-06-01, this worktree, release build)

Harness: `python3 scripts/kernel_readiness_harness.py --iters 50` (50 timed
iterations per runtime after a 5-run warmup; nearest-rank percentiles). The
kernel column is **PATH A** — the exact live `inject_bindings + run_recipe`
subprocess dispatch.

| Endpoint | Value parity | CPython p50 | Kernel A p50 | p95 / p99 | Ratio (p50) | `.fk` compile (once) |
|----------|:---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `coherence_weight` | ✓ 16185 | 0.0007 ms | 5.01 ms | 5.68 / 11.39 ms | ~7,100× | 770 ms |
| `nodeid_distance` | ✓ 7 | 0.0004 ms | 5.03 ms | 5.44 / 5.76 ms | ~13,400× | 685 ms |
| `nodeid_compatibility` | ✓ 2 | 0.0004 ms | 4.88 ms | 5.47 / 5.52 ms | ~11,700× | 701 ms |
| `weighted_average` | ✓ 0.8125 | 0.0004 ms | 4.87 ms | 5.35 / 5.63 ms | ~11,700× | 688 ms |

**Stability under replay:** kernel A latency is stable across 50 iterations
(stdev 0.28–0.97 ms, p99 within ~2× of p50 except one 11 ms outlier on the
first endpoint — GC/scheduler jitter, not drift). **No leak or degradation**
across the run. The response SHAPE is intact: the kernel returns the scalar
(`int`/`float`) the response model's headline field expects; the other fields
(`values`, `threshold`, `runtime`, …) are echoed by the host.

### Where the 5 ms goes — the decisive breakdown

Isolating spawn from compute (40 iters each, warmed):

| Measurement | p50 |
|-------------|----:|
| Bare kernel spawn (trivial `(do 1)` recipe) | **4.37 ms** |
| Kernel spawn + `coherence_weight` recipe | 4.52 ms |
| **Recipe execution only (full − spawn)** | **~0.15 ms** |

The ~5 ms is **process spawn**, not computation. The recipe itself executes in
**~0.15 ms** — competitive with, and for non-trivial work potentially faster
than, CPython. The entire readiness gap is fork+exec overhead paid per request.

### PATH B (the full python-bmf pipeline per call)

`pyfkb-run.sh --kernel rust` on `coherence_weight`: **~310 ms/call** (p50),
≈440,000× CPython and ≈62× even PATH A. It re-source-compiles the BML preludes
every invocation. **This path cannot serve load as a per-call shell-out** — it
is a correctness/parity instrument. It only becomes a serving path with a
persistent kernel process that compiles the preludes once and stays warm.

## The persistent-serve model — the apples-to-apples number

The fix to the wrong comparison is already in the kernel:
[`form/form-kernel-rust/src/main.rs`](../form/form-kernel-rust/src/main.rs)
`cli_serve` (`form-kernel-rust serve --port P --routes file.fk`). It loads a
`routes.fk` ONCE into a long-lived `Kernel + Arena`, holds the top-level
`routes` binding (a list of `(path handler-closure)` pairs), starts an HTTP/1.0
listener, and dispatches each request to the matching handler with a **fresh
child frame** — **no per-request process spawn, no per-request source-compile.**
This is the warm-process counterpart to a CPython worker.

The route table the harness registers is
[`scripts/kernel_readiness_routes.fk`](../scripts/kernel_readiness_routes.fk):
the four endpoint computations bound once as `(defn …)` recipes (the SAME bodies
the live endpoints run, captured from the `endpoint_*_demo.py` shapes), each
wrapped in a handler closure. A request → handler call → recipe walk → response
body is one in-process movement.

**Measured (2026-06-01, this worktree, release build,
`--persistent --iters 200`):**

| Endpoint | Value parity | CPython p50 | **Serve p50** | Serve p95 / p99 | Serve verdict |
|----------|:---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `coherence_weight` | ✓ 16185 | 0.0007 ms | **0.189 ms** | 0.243 / 0.265 ms | READY (shape) |
| `nodeid_distance` | ✓ 7 | 0.0004 ms | **0.231 ms** | 0.262 / 0.288 ms | READY (shape) |
| `nodeid_compatibility` | ✓ 2 | 0.0004 ms | **0.235 ms** | 0.264 / 0.278 ms | READY (shape) |
| `weighted_average` | ✓ 0.8125 | 0.0004 ms | **0.090 ms** | 0.134 / 0.192 ms | READY (shape) |

**The real ratio, spawn removed.** Per-request latency over the warm channel is
**~0.09–0.24 ms p50, p99 under 0.29 ms** — sub-millisecond, **~20–40× faster
than the ~5 ms spawn-bound PATH A.** Against CPython's bare-compute p50
(~0.0004 ms) the *ratio* still reads as a few-hundred×, but that ratio is the
wrong lens: CPython's headline is a sub-microsecond arithmetic loop with **zero
transport**, while the kernel number includes a full HTTP/1.0 loopback
round-trip. Judge on the **absolute**: ~0.2 ms request→response is negligible
overhead for an HTTP endpoint (the network and FastAPI's own routing dwarf it).

**What the ~0.2 ms is made of.** It is dominated by the HTTP/1.0 loopback
(connect + request line + 8 KiB read + response write) and the string-alist
marshalling, **not** recipe execution. The recipe walk itself is the same
~0.15 ms (or less, for these tiny recipes) the PATH A breakdown isolated. So the
persistent serve confirms the earlier prediction empirically: **the kernel was
never the bottleneck — the spawn was.**

### Honest limits of the serve mode (proof-of-shape, not production)

`cli_serve` is a ~50-line raw `std::net` HTTP/1.0 listener. It is the right shape
to *measure* the persistent model; it is **not** a production HTTP server. Named
plainly:

- **HTTP/1.0, no keep-alive** — every request is a fresh TCP connection. A real
  serving path wants keep-alive or an in-process call (PyO3), which removes even
  the connect cost.
- **Single-threaded, sequential** — one request at a time. No concurrency.
- **String-only query alist** — the query string arrives as `(list (key value)…)`
  with every value a STRING. The two integer NodeID endpoints marshal cleanly
  (8 int query params, parsed with `str_to_int`); `coherence_weight` and
  `weighted_average` take a **list** (and floats), and the kernel ships no
  `split` / `str_to_float` native, so their handlers compute the **frozen
  sample input** — the recipe body that runs is identical to live, but the
  per-request *inputs* are not yet marshalled from the wire. List/float query
  marshalling is the named gap, not a measured failure.
- **No Pydantic, no validation, no async** — those stay in FastAPI regardless.

The serve mode proves **the persistent shape is sound and sub-ms**. The
production carrier of that shape is the **inline PyO3** path (a warm `Kernel`
held in-process, called by FastAPI with no socket at all) — same warm-kernel
win, no HTTP/1.0 limits. **That carrier is now built and measured** — next
section.

## The inline PyO3 carrier — the production hot path, built and measured

The persistent-serve number is dominated by HTTP/1.0 loopback, not compute. The
inline carrier removes the loopback entirely: the `form_kernel_rust` PyO3
extension is imported **once** at `form_kernel_bridge` module load — a warm Rust
runtime living *inside* the Python process — and each request is a C call
straight into `compile_and_run`, returning an already-typed Python value
(`int`/`float`/`list`). No process spawn, no socket. This is the path
`serve_via_kernel` takes first whenever `inline_available()` is true.

**What was built (2026-06-01).** The PyO3 surface already existed in source
([`form/form-kernel-rust/src/lib.rs`](../form/form-kernel-rust/src/lib.rs),
`Cargo.toml` `[lib] crate-type=["cdylib","rlib"]` + `pyo3` feature,
`pyproject.toml` maturin config, bridge wired to `compile_and_run`) but had
**never been built** — it didn't compile against the current kernel. Two shallow
breaks fixed:

1. `src/main.rs` `crate::bp_table::BP_ENTRIES` → `self::bp_table::BP_ENTRIES` —
   a path that resolves in **both** the bin build (where `main.rs` is the crate
   root) and the lib build (where `main.rs` is `mod kernel`).
2. `src/lib.rs` `value_to_py` gained the missing `Value::Record(_)` arm
   (renders via the kernel's own `display()`, same surface as the CLI).

Then `maturin develop --release` (maturin 1.13.3, Rust 1.95, CPython 3.11,
abi3-py39) built and installed `form_kernel_rust` into the API venv. The bridge
loads it (`inline_available() == True`, `active_runtime() == "inline"`) and
`serve_via_kernel` returns typed values via the warm kernel with no spawn.

**Measured (2026-06-01, this worktree, release build, `--inline --persistent
--iters 300`):**

| Endpoint | Value parity | CPython p50 | Serve p50 | **Inline p50** | **Inline p99** | Serve→Inline |
|----------|:---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `coherence_weight` | ✓ 16185 | 0.0008 ms | 0.176 ms | **0.128 ms** | **0.190 ms** | 1.4× faster |
| `nodeid_distance` | ✓ 7 | 0.0004 ms | 0.244 ms | **0.050 ms** | **0.078 ms** | 4.9× faster |
| `nodeid_compatibility` | ✓ 2 | 0.0004 ms | 0.241 ms | **0.054 ms** | **0.085 ms** | 4.5× faster |
| `weighted_average` | ✓ 0.8125 | 0.0004 ms | 0.107 ms | **0.092 ms** | **0.139 ms** | 1.2× faster |

**Inline beats serve on all four, and the loopback was the difference.** On the
two integer NodeID endpoints — which marshal real inputs both ways (no frozen
sample) — inline is **~4.5–4.9× faster** than serve, landing at **sub-100µs p99**
(0.078 / 0.085 ms). That delta is precisely the HTTP/1.0 connect + request-line
+ read/write round-trip that serve pays and inline does not. `coherence_weight`
and `weighted_average` carry list/float inputs that the inline path injects as
`.fk` literals per request (the inject + larger recipe walk), so their win over
serve is smaller (1.2–1.4×) but still real, and still sub-200µs p99.

**Value parity holds exactly inline** — 16185 / 7 / 2 / 0.8125, with types
preserved (ints stay `int`, 0.8125 is a `float`, via `value_to_py`). The inline
path returns the response model's headline scalar directly; the host echoes the
other fields, same as serve.

**Why the CPython ratio is still the wrong lens.** Inline p50 / CPython p50 reads
as ~130–250× — but CPython's headline is a sub-microsecond arithmetic loop with
**zero transport and zero recipe machinery**. Inline's ~0.05–0.13 ms includes
inject + a C boundary crossing + a full recipe walk. Judge on the **absolute**:
**sub-100µs p99 for the integer endpoints, sub-200µs for the list/float ones** —
negligible against FastAPI routing + Pydantic + the network, which dwarf it.

**Honest limit of these inline numbers — now closed.** The inline path above
still re-parses the `.fk` source per request inside `compile_and_run` — it
removes the *spawn* and the *loopback*, not the per-request parse. For these tiny
recipes the parse is a small fraction of the sub-100µs envelope, but a fully warm
carrier holds the *pre-parsed recipe root* and re-walks only with fresh bindings
(the same shape `cli_serve` uses internally with its loaded `routes` list). That
`load_route + run(handle, bindings)` pair is **now built and measured** — the
next section. The `compile_and_run` numbers above stay the honest baseline the
preload path is measured against.

## The route-preload carrier — the parse dropped, built and measured

The inline `compile_and_run` re-tokenizes and re-reads the **whole** recipe on
every call (`run_source` → `read_root_from_source` → `tokenize_sexp` +
`read_sexp`), then re-walks every `defn` to re-bind its closure before the
trailing call. For a fixed-shape endpoint whose only per-request change is the
input values, that parse + `defn`-rebind is pure overhead paid each request.

**What was built (2026-06-01).** A `Preloader` `#[pyclass]` on the PyO3 module
([`form/form-kernel-rust/src/lib.rs`](../form/form-kernel-rust/src/lib.rs)) holds
a long-lived `Kernel + Arena + root_env` — mirroring `cli_serve`'s pattern. Two
methods:

- `load_route(setup_src, body_src) → handle` — walks `setup_src` (the recipe's
  `defn`s) **once** into the root frame so its closures bind a single time, then
  parses `body_src` (the trailing call) into a held `NodeID`. Returns an opaque
  handle (an index into the `Preloader`'s route `Vec`). Reuses the kernel's
  existing `read_root_from_source` + `walk` — no reimplemented parser.
- `run(handle, bindings) → value` — converts the bindings dict to kernel
  `Value`s, binds them into a **fresh child frame** of the root, and walks the
  pre-parsed body `NodeID`. No tokenize, no read, no `defn`-rebind. Converts the
  result through the **same `value_to_py`** the inline path uses, so value-parity
  is exact.

ONE mechanism, routes as DATA: every endpoint is a `(setup, body)` pair indexed
by handle; no endpoint is special-cased. The Python bridge owns the recipe text,
so the split (which `(let …)` forms carry per-request inputs vs the `defn`/const
setup) lives in `form_kernel_bridge.split_recipe`, keeping the Rust side
recipe-agnostic. The minimal main.rs change was **visibility only** — `Arena`
(+ `new`/`new_frame`/`new_frame_with_capacity`/`bind`/`lookup`), `walk`, and
`read_root_from_source` became `pub(crate)` so lib.rs can hold the warm kernel;
no evaluator logic changed. `serve_via_kernel` takes the preload path first when
the `Preloader` is available; it reports `runtime == "inline"` (preload is a
sub-mode of the inline carrier, not a new carrier class) and falls through to
inline-with-parse if a recipe doesn't split/parse cleanly.

**Measured (2026-06-01, this worktree, release build, `--inline --preload
--iters 2000`, reproduced across two runs):**

| Endpoint | Value parity | **Inline-with-parse p50** | **Preload p50** | Preload p95 / p99 | Parse drop | Speedup |
|----------|:---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `coherence_weight` | ✓ 16185 | 0.1263 ms | **0.0475 ms** | 0.058 / 0.086 ms | **−78.7µs** | **2.66×** |
| `nodeid_distance` | ✓ 7 | 0.0511 ms | **0.0037 ms** | 0.0047 / 0.0078 ms | **−47.4µs** | **13.93×** |
| `nodeid_compatibility` | ✓ 2 | 0.0544 ms | **0.0043 ms** | 0.0055 / 0.0063 ms | **−50.1µs** | **12.56×** |
| `weighted_average` | ✓ 0.8125 | 0.0902 ms | **0.0174 ms** | 0.0212 / 0.0292 ms | **−72.8µs** | **5.19×** |

**The parse was a real, stable cost — and it's gone.** Dropping the per-request
parse cuts p50 by a **fixed ~47–79µs** (mean **62µs**), reproducible to within
~1µs across runs. The two integer NodeID endpoints — whose recipes are tiny, so
the parse dominated — drop **~13–14×**, landing at **3–4µs p50, sub-10µs p99**.
The list/float endpoints carry a larger recipe walk, so the parse is a smaller
fraction; they still drop **2.7–5.2×** (the same absolute ~73–79µs saved),
landing at **17–48µs p50, sub-90µs p99**. The walk itself is now the entire
per-request cost — there is nothing left to remove inside the kernel for these
recipes.

**Value parity holds exactly** — 16185 / 7 / 2 / 0.8125, types preserved (ints
stay `int`, 0.8125 a `float`), via the same `value_to_py` the inline path uses.
The bridge's `serve_via_kernel` returns these through the preload path while
reporting `runtime == "inline"`, so the live response contract is unchanged.

**Honest limit.** `load_route` is called once per `(recipe, binding-name-set)`
at first request and cached; that first call pays the split + parse (a one-time
cost, not per-request). The preload handle map is process-local — a fresh worker
re-preloads on its first request (sub-millisecond, paid once). Input marshalling
is now **fully typed end-to-end**: Python hands the kernel `int`/`float`/`list`
values directly through `py_to_value`, so unlike the serve path there is **no
frozen-sample gap** — all four endpoints, including the list/float ones, run
their **real per-request inputs**. That closes the serve mode's named
list/float-marshalling gap for the inline carrier.

## JIT — what `register_jit` and `jit_compile` actually do today

Two distinct mechanisms live in the kernel, and the honest readiness map keeps
them apart:

- **`register_jit form-name native-name`** (main.rs ~line 2669) — **aliases** a
  Form recipe name to an *existing host-native*. It is a dispatch hint, not a
  compiler: it only speeds a recipe when an equivalent native already exists
  (e.g. aliasing a Form `my-count` to native `len`). For the four endpoint
  recipes there is **no native equivalent**, so `register_jit` buys nothing.
- **`jit_compile form-name`** (main.rs ~line 2733) — a **real recipe→machine-code
  compiler**: it emits Rust source from the Form recipe, invokes the system
  `rustc --crate-type=cdylib`, loads the `.so` via `libloading`, and dispatches
  subsequent calls through the native function pointer. This is genuine native
  compilation, not aliasing.

**What `jit_compile` buys, measured.** On a recipe *inside its emit subset* —
`fib` written with the operator forms `emit_rust_source` covers
(`add`/`sub`/`lt`) — the harness measured **8× `fib(30)` walked = ~10,375 ms vs
recipe→native = ~485 ms: a ~21× speedup, INCLUDING the one-time rustc compile.**
Steady-state (compile amortized) is higher still. The compiler is real and the
win is large.

**Why it is a no-op for the four endpoints — the precise gap.** `jit_compile`
returns **0** (honest "unavailable") for all four endpoint recipes. The cause is
**emit coverage**, not the compiler:

- `emit_rust_source` / `emit_expr` cover the **operator** recipe shapes —
  `RB_MATH` (`add sub mul div mod`), `RB_COMPARE`, `RB_LOGIC`, `RB_COND`, and
  calls to **sibling Form functions**. They emit i64-only Rust.
- The Python adapter compiles arithmetic to **native calls** — `_plus`, `abs`,
  `_get`, `_iter`, `head`, `tail`, `len`, `nth` — which fall through to
  `RB_FNCALL` against natives the emitter cannot inline (it would have to call
  back into the walker). The endpoint recipes also use **lists and floats**,
  both outside the i64 emit subset entirely.

So the gap to a real recipe-JIT *for these endpoints* is concrete: the emitter
needs (1) native-builtin inlining or a native→Rust shim for `_plus`/`abs`/list
ops, (2) **f64** emission (today it is i64-only), and (3) list/iteration
lowering. None of that is exotic — it is emit-coverage work on a compiler that
already produces and loads real machine code. Until then: **persistent serve is
what gets the endpoints to sub-ms; `jit_compile` is the proven path to native
for the *operator* subset and the named extension for the rest.**

## Honest verdict — per call

Two models, stated separately so the correction is legible:

| Endpoint | PATH A (fork+exec — WRONG model) | Persistent serve (HTTP loopback) | Inline PyO3 (parse each call) | **Route-preload (parse dropped)** |
|----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `coherence_weight` | NOT-YET — +5 ms/req spawn | 0.176 ms p50 | 0.128 ms p50, 0.190 p99 | **0.048 ms p50, 0.086 p99 — READY** |
| `nodeid_distance` | NOT-YET — spawn-bound | 0.244 ms p50 | 0.050 ms p50, 0.078 p99 | **0.004 ms p50, 0.008 p99 — READY** |
| `nodeid_compatibility` | NOT-YET — spawn-bound | 0.241 ms p50 | 0.054 ms p50, 0.085 p99 | **0.004 ms p50, 0.006 p99 — READY** |
| `weighted_average` | NOT-YET — spawn-bound | 0.107 ms p50 | 0.092 ms p50, 0.139 p99 | **0.017 ms p50, 0.029 p99 — READY** |

The four-point profile: per-request **fork+exec** (~5 ms, the wrong model) →
**persistent serve** (~0.1–0.24 ms, sub-ms but HTTP/1.0-loopback-bound) →
**inline PyO3, parse each call** (~0.05–0.13 ms, the loopback gone) →
**route-preload** (~0.004–0.048 ms, the parse gone). Each step removes a cost the
previous paid: spawn → loopback → per-request parse. Route-preload is the floor a
synchronous in-process kernel reaches for these recipes — what remains per
request is only the recipe walk itself.

"READY" here means: correct (4/4 value parity inline, types preserved), stable
percentiles, and a **sub-100µs-to-sub-200µs absolute envelope with no spawn and
no socket** — the warm-in-process carrier the readiness evidence named. It is
**healthy to carry the four transmuted endpoints' computational core.** What
remains before a production flip is the deploy-image build of the extension and
the per-request-parse refinement (both named below), not a profile question —
the profile is met.

Read precisely:

- **Correctness is met.** 4/4 value parity over the warm channel, stable
  percentiles, response shape intact.
- **Under the persistent model the kernel is sub-ms.** ~0.09–0.24 ms p50,
  p99 under 0.29 ms — and most of that is HTTP/1.0 loopback, not recipe
  execution. The per-request-spawn ~5 ms was an artifact of the wrong harness
  shape, never the kernel's cost.
- **The production carrier is built and measured.** **Inline PyO3** (the
  `form_kernel_rust` extension imported once at module load, called by FastAPI
  with no socket) is now built in this worktree and measured at **0.05–0.13 ms
  p50, sub-200µs p99 — faster than serve on all four, ~4.5–4.9× faster on the
  integer endpoints where the HTTP loopback was the whole difference.** The
  bridge routes to it first when available. What turns this into "READY
  (production)" is the **deploy-image build** of the extension (the same
  `maturin develop --release` this worktree ran), plus the per-request-parse
  refinement — not a further profile question.

The number that matters for the flip decision: **with the kernel inline,
request→response compute is ~0.05–0.13 ms — sub-100µs p99 on the integer
endpoints, HTTP-negligible.** The flip needs a **warm kernel**; the warm kernel
now exists as a built PyO3 extension with a measured profile, not a prediction.

## What's needed before a real flip

1. **Build the inline PyO3 kernel in the deploy image.** ✅ **Built and measured
   in this worktree (2026-06-01)** — `maturin develop --release` into the API
   venv; inline lands **below** the serve number (~4.5–4.9× faster on the integer
   endpoints, sub-200µs p99 across all four). What remains is reproducing that
   build **in the deploy image**: add `maturin` to the API image build and run
   `cd form/form-kernel-rust && maturin build --release` (or `develop` into the
   image's venv) so `form_kernel_rust` imports in production. Then the live
   `active_runtime()` reports `inline` and `/api/health` shows the hot path.
   *Refinement — done (2026-06-01):* the per-request parse is dropped. The
   `Preloader` `load_route + run(handle, bindings)` PyO3 pair parses each recipe
   once and walks only the pre-parsed body per request, cutting p50 a further
   2.6–14× (mean ~62µs drop). See "The route-preload carrier". The deploy-image
   build is the same `maturin develop --release`; it picks up the `Preloader`
   class automatically — no extra build step.
2. **Marshal real inputs over the channel.** The two list/float endpoints
   currently compute a frozen sample under serve because the string-only query
   alist plus the missing `split` / `str_to_float` natives can't carry a list.
   Add list/float wire-marshalling (or do it inline via PyO3 where Python hands
   the kernel typed values directly) so every endpoint marshals its real inputs.
3. **Capture real traffic.** Today's inputs are **representative-derived** from
   the endpoints' query defaults / Pydantic contracts, *not* sampled from
   production. Add a request-log → replay corpus so the profile reflects real
   value distributions (list sizes, edge cases), not one frozen input each.
4. **Grow the captured-call corpus** to cover input-size scaling (10 → 100 →
   1000-element value lists) — the persistent overhead is fixed, but recipe
   execution scales with input; the crossover where kernel compute beats CPython
   is worth measuring.
5. **JIT the hot paths.** Extend `emit_rust_source` to cover the native-builtin
   and f64/list shapes the endpoint recipes use (today it is i64 + operators +
   sibling-calls only), so `jit_compile` can lower them to native — the same
   compiler that already buys ~21× on the operator subset.
6. **Load levels + concurrency.** Re-run at `--iters 1000`+ and under concurrent
   clients to confirm stability holds at serving rates (the serve mode is
   single-threaded — concurrency needs PyO3-inline or a threaded listener).
7. **Latency envelope that counts as healthy:** for an HTTP endpoint, p99 kernel
   overhead under ~1 ms over the CPython baseline. The persistent serve already
   meets this (p99 < 0.3 ms); inline PyO3 is expected to beat it.

## Running the evidence

```bash
python3 scripts/kernel_readiness_harness.py                          # PATH A, 50 iters
python3 scripts/kernel_readiness_harness.py --persistent             # + the warm serve path (apples-to-apples)
python3 scripts/kernel_readiness_harness.py --inline                 # + the warm in-process PyO3 path (parse each call)
python3 scripts/kernel_readiness_harness.py --inline --preload       # + route-preload (parse dropped); names the per-call parse drop
python3 scripts/kernel_readiness_harness.py --inline --persistent    # the spawn → loopback → inline profile
python3 scripts/kernel_readiness_harness.py --inline --persistent --preload  # the full four-point profile
python3 scripts/kernel_readiness_harness.py --persistent --jit       # + serve+jit mode and the JIT demonstrator
python3 scripts/kernel_readiness_harness.py --iters 1000 --inline    # load replay, inline
python3 scripts/kernel_readiness_harness.py --path-b                 # include PATH B
python3 scripts/kernel_readiness_harness.py --json out.json          # machine-readable
```

The `--inline` mode requires the `form_kernel_rust` PyO3 extension built into
the running interpreter (`maturin develop --release` from
`form/form-kernel-rust/`); when it is absent the harness reports the inline
verdict as `UNAVAILABLE` and the other modes are unaffected.

The harness exits nonzero **only** on a value-parity failure. Slowness is
reported as evidence, never as a test failure — the profile informs the flip
decision; it does not gate CI. The persistent serve mode starts one
`form-kernel-rust serve` process per mode, fires all requests over it, and kills
it on exit; no listener is left running.
