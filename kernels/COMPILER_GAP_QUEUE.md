# Compiler Gap Queue — Python→Form coverage, one construct per breath

## The pipeline (destination path, not the TS bootstrap)

```
.py source → form-stdlib/grammars/python-bmf.fk   (scanner + BMF rules — parses ~all of Python already)
           → form-stdlib/python-bmf-lift.fk        (statement/expr tree → PY-BMF-* recipes)   ← most gaps live HERE
           → form-stdlib/python-bmf-eval.fk        (walk PY-BMF-* recipes → runtime value)    ← some arms already shipped
```

The grammar already parses nearly every Python construct. The gaps are
almost all **lift** (and sometimes **eval**), never the scanner. That is
what makes each construct a small, isolated breath.

## The proven template (copy-paste, from the aug-assign breath #2168)

Adding one construct end-to-end is three edits:

1. **Lift** (`python-bmf-lift.fk`): write a `lift-X` that consumes the
   statement-tree / token list and returns `(intern_node PY-BMF-X children)`.
   For statements, add a dispatch branch in `lift-statement` (before the
   `kind "expr"` fallthrough). For expressions, add to `lift-primary`.
   - Token accessors: `tok-kind`, `tok-value`, `tok-op?`, `tok-name?`,
     `tok-int?`. Tokens are BMF objects.
   - `drop`, `nth`, `head`, `tail`, `reverse` available from core.fk.
   - A statement's classification: `python-statement-tree-kind` (first-token
     classifier) + `python-statement-tree-cpython-rule` (richer rule name).
     Probe an unknown construct with a `trace` to see what it classifies as
     before writing the branch — e.g. `x += 3` is `kind "expr"` /
     `rule "star_expressions"`, NOT its own kind. The lifter must catch it
     by token shape before the bare-expr arm.

2. **Eval** (`python-bmf-eval.fk`): if no arm exists, add
   `(if (node_eq cat PY-BMF-X) <arm> <rest>)` in `py-eval` (expressions,
   returns a value) or `py-eval-statement` (statements, returns
   `(py-stmt-result value env)`). Many arms are **already shipped** ahead of
   their lift — check the EVAL list below first; if it's there, you only
   write lift (the cheapest breath — this is exactly what aug-assign was).
   - `py-binop-apply` handles `+ - * / % //`; `py-compare-apply` handles
     `== != < <= > >=`. Reuse them — lift emits the **base** op string.

3. **Test** (`python-bmf-lift-band.fk`): add `(let cellN-value
   (py-bmf-run-text "…python…"))` + `(let cellN-score (if (eq cellN-value
   EXPECTED) POINTS 0))`, and add `cellN-score` to the final `(sum …)`.
   Expected value must match CPython. Per-cell offsets make a regression
   name itself.

### Validating locally (IMPORTANT — read before trusting a red)

`./validate.sh <band.fk>` in **explicit single-file mode does NOT read the
`; preludes:` header** — it runs only the files you name, so a band run that
way reports everything `unbound`. That is not a failure of your code.

- **Local gate:** compile the three `section [` preludes (`core.fk`,
  `compiler.fk`, `grammars/python-bmf.fk`) via `form-source-compile-file`,
  then run the full prepared chain through Go + Rust. The band returns its
  aggregate integer; both kernels must agree.
- **Authoritative three-way (incl. TypeScript):** CI's no-arg
  `validate-thread-process` suite — it walks `form-stdlib/tests/*.fk`,
  reads each band's `; preludes:` header, and runs Go/Rust/TS. Trust CI's
  green over a local red from explicit-mode invocation.

See [[self_form_kernel_local_toolchain]] (memory) for the full trap.

## Coverage snapshot (2026-05-29, after #2179 — Batch 1 complete)

**Eval arms shipped (15):** AUG-ASSIGN, ASSIGN, CALL, DEF, DICT, FOR, IDENT,
IF, INT, LIST, MODULE, RETURN, STRING, SUBSCRIPT, WHILE
**Lift branches shipped:** AUG-ASSIGN, DICT, FOR, IF, INT, LIST, MODULE,
PASS, SUBSCRIPT, WHILE, unary `-`/`not`, boolean `and`/`or`
(+ ASSIGN/RETURN/DEF/CALL/BINOP/COMPARE/IDENT/STRING via dedicated lifters)
**Band aggregate:** 135000 (18 cells)

**Desugaring wins (no new eval arm):** unary `-x` → MATH-MINUS(0,x);
`not x` → COMPARE-EQ(x,0); `a and b` → IF(a,b,a); `a or b` → IF(a,a,b).
Whenever a construct's semantics reduce to an existing recipe shape, lift
desugars and eval is untouched — the cheapest kind of breath.

## The queue

### Batch 1 — cheap (lift-only; eval already shipped or trivial). Do first.

| Construct | Why cheap | Independence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **dict literal `{k: v}`** | `PY-BMF-DICT` eval shipped; `lift-primary` branch + value_eq lookup fix | edits `lift-primary` (shared) | **DONE #2174** |
| `for x in xs:` | folds over a LIST via `py-eval-body-loop` | new `lift-for` + `py-eval-statement` arm | **DONE #2175** (list iterables; `range()` pending) |
| unary `-x` / `not x` | desugars: `-x`→MATH-MINUS(0,x), `not x`→COMPARE-EQ(x,0) — pure lift, no eval arm | edits `lift-primary` | **DONE #2178** |
| boolean `and` / `or` | desugars to PY-BMF-IF (short-circuit) — pure lift, no eval arm | edits `op-prec` + `tok-binop-prec` + `lift-binop-loop` | **DONE #2179** |
| `range(n)` as iterable | `range()` builtin produces a Form list so `for i in range(n)` walks | eval-side CALL intercept (`py-range`) | **DONE #2181** (range(stop) + range(start,stop); step pending) |

**Batch 1 is complete** — the cheap (mostly lift-only) tier is done. `range()`
remains as a small follow-up that unblocks the most common substrate loop
idiom; it's eval-side (a builtin producing a list) rather than a lift gap.

### Batch 2 — substrate-critical heavy (constructs the target files use most)

Ranked by frequency across `api/app/services/substrate/*.py`:

| Construct | Hits in substrate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **f-strings** | `form_runtime.py` 62, `form.py` 32 | grammar parses; lift + eval (string-build over interpolations) |
| **`class` + `@dataclass`** | `form.py` 50, `category.py` 34 | plain-class eval exists; dataclass + dunders are the real work |
| **decorators** | `form.py` 50 | lift wraps the decorated def in a call chain |
| **`try`/`except`** | `form_runtime.py` 12 | needs an exception-stack data shape in eval |
| **comprehensions** | `form_runtime.py` 10 | desugar to a fold over the iterable |
| **`from … import` as module** | 28 files | needs module-system semantics; ORM calls also need the Form persistence runtime, not SQLAlchemy |

### Not a compiler gap — a runtime gap

`kernel.py` (49 ORM hits), `orm.py`, `markdown_frontend.py` (43) call
`session.query(...)`/`Column(...)`. Even fully compiled, those bind to a
runtime the kernel doesn't have. They compile only after their `session.*`
calls are rebound to the Form persistence runtime (`cell-put`/`lookup-cell`,
[`form-stdlib/persistence.fk`](../form/form-stdlib/persistence.fk), Breath 5)
— NOT SQLAlchemy. Compile the pure-computation files first
(`form_eval.py`, `category.py`, `numeric_formats.py`, `inductive.py` — the
zero-ORM ones); the ORM-bound files wait on the runtime.

## Parallelization

Disjoint helper functions can be authored in parallel worktrees; the shared
**dispatch** points serialize (last writer rebases the if-chain branch):
- `lift-statement` if-chain — every new *statement* kind adds a branch
- `py-eval` / `py-eval-statement` if-chains — every new arm
- `lift-primary` — every new *expression* atom

So: implement the `lift-X`/`py-eval-X` *bodies* in parallel, then land the
one-line dispatch branches in series. The band's per-cell offsets keep
merges honest — a dropped construct subtracts its unique value from the sum.
