# Coherence Network - Claude Project Knowledge Base

This folder contains documentation optimized for Claude Projects to efficiently work with the Coherence Network codebase.

## Quick Start for Claude

1. **First Time?** Read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for a 2-minute overview
2. **Writing Code?** Reference `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `API_REFERENCE.md`
3. **Helping Users?** Use `EXAMPLES.md` for copy-paste solutions
4. **Debugging?** Check `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
5. **Need Definitions?** See `GLOSSARY.md`

## File Guide

| File | Purpose | When to Read |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` | Project overview | First interaction |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Technical details | Generating code |
| `CONTRIBUTION_GUIDE.md` | How to contribute | Recording contributions |
| `API_REFERENCE.md` | API documentation | Making API calls |
| `ECONOMIC_MODEL.md` | Economic system | Understanding "why" |
| `DATABASE_SCHEMAS.md` | Database structure | Writing queries |
| `EXAMPLES.md` | Real examples | Showing users how |
| `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` | Common issues | Debugging |
| `GLOSSARY.md` | Term definitions | Clarifying terms |
| `CURSOR_WORKFLOWS.md` | Cursor prompts | Using Cursor AI |

## Usage Tips for Claude

- Always check `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` first to understand the conversation context
- Reference `ECONOMIC_MODEL.md` when explaining why features exist
- Use exact examples from `EXAMPLES.md` rather than making up new ones
- Cite specific sections when answering questions (e.g., "According to ARCHITECTURE.md...")
- Keep terminology consistent with `GLOSSARY.md`

## Maintaining This Knowledge Base

Update these files whenever:
- Architecture changes (update ARCHITECTURE.md)
- New API endpoints added (update API_REFERENCE.md)
- Economic model changes (update ECONOMIC_MODEL.md)
- New examples discovered (add to EXAMPLES.md)
- Common bugs found (add to TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

**Remember**: Updating documentation is a contribution! Record it in the system.
