# Glossary

**Asset**: Any generated entity (code, model, content, data) that tracks its creation lineage and can distribute value to contributors.

**Coherence**: A quality score (0.0 to 1.0) measuring how well a contribution aligns with network goals and quality standards.

**Coherence Multiplier**: Factor applied to cost (0.5 + coherence) that weights payout share. Range: 0.5x to 1.5x.

**Contribution Event**: An immutable record of work done, including cost, coherence score, and metadata.

**Contributor**: A person (HUMAN) or system (SYSTEM) that contributes to assets.

**Creation Distribution Ledger**: The complete DAG of all contributions to an asset, used for value distribution.

**Distribution**: The act of routing generated value back to contributors proportionally.

**Event Sourcing**: Storing state as a sequence of immutable events rather than current state.

**Graph Lineage**: The tree/DAG structure showing how an asset was created from contributions.

**Node Operator**: A contributor who provides hosting resources (API, storage, compute) to the network.

**Payout**: An individual payment to a contributor from a distribution.

**Resonance**: Network-level coherence measuring alignment across the entire system.

**Tool Attribution**: Attributing system/AI tool costs to the human who triggered them.

**Treasury**: Network's reserve fund for operational costs and distributions.

**Value Generation**: When an asset produces revenue or utility that can be distributed.

**Weighted Cost**: A contribution's cost multiplied by its coherence multiplier.
