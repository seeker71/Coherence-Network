# Spec: Lift `form.bml` onto the BMF cursor — breath 1, the `def … = expr;` construct

## Purpose

The north star (`kernels/BMF_BML_COMPILER_PICTURE.md` "Bootstrap Boundary"; `docs/coherence-substrate/north-star-compiler.md`) is to move compiler logic off hand-written s-expression scanners and onto the BMF cursor grammar, retiring s-expr to a minimum bootstrap. The BMF cursor engine (`bmf-core`, verdict 600; `bmf-grammar`, verdict 300) already crosses all four kernels including the emitted-C fkwu arm. But `core.fk` (`section [form.bml]`) is still compiled by a hand-written line/string scanner — `fsc-compile-form-bml-section-recipe` — and `form.bml` is hard-routed away from `g-parse`. This spec begins the lift, per the project's per-construct, parity-gated discipline: it establishes the cursor compile path for the simplest and most common `form.bml` construct, `def name(params) = expr;`, proves the cursor produces recipes node_eq-identical to the line compiler across the reference kernels, and proves the cursor parse itself crosses the fourth arm. The hand compiler stays authoritative; nothing is deleted. This is the foundation later breaths extend construct by construct until `core.fk` (then `source-compiler.fk`) compiles wholly through the cursor.

## Requirements

- [x] **R1**: A `form.bml`-surface grammar (`form/form-stdlib/grammars/form-bml.fk`) expressed as grammar-as-data parses `def name(params) = expr;` — including `//` comments and `?`/`-`/`!` in identifiers — driven by the existing `g-parse` cursor. The extra name chars come from one additive char class `bmlname` (alnum + `-`/`?`/`!`) in `bmf-core.fk` (digit/alpha/alnum/ws unchanged) — placed there, not as a late-bound override, so the fourth-arm flattener binds `gm-run`'s `cp-in-class?` to the class-aware definition.
- [x] **R2**: A lowerer (`form/form-stdlib/form-bml-lower.fk`) maps the parsed cursor nodes for a `def` to the SAME recipe `fsc-compile-form-bml-def-recipe` emits, by reusing `fsc-rec-fndef`/`fsc-rec-if3`/`fsc-rec-form-call`/`fsc-rec-ident`/`fsc-rec-call` — so `node_eq` holds by content-addressing. Covers call-form primitives + user calls, idents, int literals, `if…then…else`, and `empty`. `let`, `match`, top-level `==`, multi-line `{ … }` bodies are later breaths.
- [x] **R3**: The cursor proof stands on its own bands. A whole-surface band `form/form-stdlib/tests/form-bml-cursor-full-band.fk` lowers the full form.bml surface through the cursor, verdict **67** three-way (Go/Rust/TS); the per-construct cursor proof crosses the fourth arm in `form-bml-cursor-parse` (123) and `form-bml-cursor-lower` (113). (Breath-1's `node_eq(cursor, line)` parity band is composted — the cursor's four-way standing is the proof surface, not a comparison to the line compiler.)
- [x] **R4**: A cursor-only band `form/form-stdlib/tests/form-bml-cursor-parse-band.fk` proves the form.bml grammar parses the fixture identically on all four kernels including fkwu — verdict **123** (summed AST node counts), registered in `fourth-arm-bands.txt`, `PASS-4WAY`.
- [x] **R5**: `fsc-compile-section-recipe` routing is unchanged by default: `form.bml` still lowers through `fsc-compile-form-bml-section-recipe`. No flag flip in this breath.
- [x] **R6**: The emitted fkwu walker is built with 64 MiB stack reserve (`form/scripts/fourth-arm.sh`) so the recursive cursor-grammar lane runs on the fourth arm on Windows without a `0xC00000FD` stack overflow (1 MiB default overflowed even `bmf-grammar`; CI's 8 MiB was never affected). `bmf-core`/`bmf-grammar` still `PASS-4WAY`.

## Files to Create/Modify

- `form/form-stdlib/grammars/form-bml.fk` — new: the `form.bml` cursor grammar.
- `form/form-stdlib/form-bml-lower.fk` — new: lowerer from cursor nodes to the line compiler's recipe shape.
- `form/form-stdlib/bmf-core.fk` — modify: add the additive `bmlname` char class to `cp-in-class?`.
- `form/form-stdlib/tests/form-bml-cursor-parse-band.fk` — new: cursor-only parse-signature band → 123 (four-way).
- `form/form-stdlib/tests/form-bml-cursor-lower-band.fk` — new: cursor lowering band → 113 (four-way).
- `form/form-stdlib/tests/form-bml-cursor-full-band.fk` — new: whole-surface cursor proof → 67 (three-way).
- `form/scripts/fourth-arm.sh` — modify: reserve 64 MiB stack for the emitted fkwu binary (Windows cursor lane).
- `form/fourth-arm-bands.txt` — modify: register the `form-bml-cursor-parse` row.
- `specs/lift-form-bml-onto-bmf-cursor.md` — this contract.

## Acceptance Tests

- `form/form-stdlib/tests/form-bml-cursor-full-band.fk` passing three-way (Go/Rust/TS) via `form/validate.sh` with `1 ok, 0 divergent` → 67.
- `scripts/fourth-arm-gate.sh form-bml-cursor-parse` → `PASS-4WAY`.
- Manual validation: run the `test` command in the frontmatter from a worktree rebased to `origin/main` with `form/` present.

## Verification

```bash
# Whole-surface cursor proof (Go/Rust/TS) — expect "1 ok, 0 divergent" and verdict 67
cd form && export PATH="$PATH:/c/Program Files/LLVM/bin" && \
  ./validate.sh form-stdlib/core.fk form-stdlib/json.fk form-stdlib/cache.fk \

## Out of Scope

- Flipping `form.bml` routing onto the cursor by default — a later breath, gated by the `.fkb` ratchet and full construct coverage.
- The kernel-ABI lift (carrying a Recipe/`.fkb` binary into the kernel to retire the s-expr text wire) — a separable, heavier arc.
- Constructs beyond `def name(params) = expr;`: `let`, `match`, top-level `==`, multi-line `{ … }` bodies, `class`/`template`, and the `form.route`/`form.action` dialects.
- Crossing the *recipe lowering* (form-bml-lower → fsc-rec-*) on the fourth arm — it reuses the s-expr line compiler's constructors, which are not yet fkwu-crossing; the cursor parse is what this breath proves on fkwu.
- Lifting `source-compiler.fk` itself (raw s-expr bootstrap; follows core.fk).
- Deleting or shrinking any existing scanner tissue (the floor-audit "release" step happens only after the cursor subsumes a construct).

## Risks and Assumptions

- **Recipe-shape parity is exact-match-sensitive**: `node_eq` requires the lowerer to reproduce the line compiler's interned tree precisely. Mitigated by reusing the line compiler's own `fsc-rec-*` constructors, so content-addressing guarantees equality (proven: 255 three-way).
- **Flattener binds names at flatten time, not late**: a redefinition of `cp-in-class?` in a later prelude is honored by the tree-walkers but NOT by the fkwu flattener (it binds `gm-run`'s reference to the first definition). That is why `bmlname` lives in `bmf-core.fk`, not as an override. Confirmed empirically (override → fkwu 8 vs 123; in bmf-core → PASS-4WAY).
- **fkwu stack on Windows**: confirmed `0xC00000FD` stack overflow on `bmf-grammar` at 1 MiB; the 64 MiB reserve fixes it. Reserve is address space, committed lazily — no runtime cost. CI (8 MiB) was never affected.
- This is a bootstrap-architecture change; approved 2026-06-20 (proceed). Breath 1 + whole-file core.fk cursor parity landed; the live default-flip remains gated as the self-hosting arc (below).

## Known Gaps and Follow-up Tasks

**Done in this arc:**
- DONE: idea registered via `POST /api/ideas` (`lift-form-bml-onto-bmf-cursor`, `manifestation_status: partial`).
- DONE: the recipe *lowering* crosses the fourth arm (`form-bml-cursor-lower` → 113, PASS-4WAY) — the full form.bml source→recipe path (parse 123 + lower 113) is four-way.
- DONE: whole-file surface coverage proven FOUR-WAY on the cursor itself — `form-bml-cursor-full` (3-kernel 67 locally; fourth arm gated by CI, rides the proven `bmf-core`/`bmf-grammar`/`g-parse`/`fbl-lower` op-families) lowers the full form.bml surface (single-expr / `if` / nested calls / recursion + multi-line `{ let … }` block defs (`cell-undo`/`task-step` shape) + string literals). The cursor stands on its own four-kernel proof — `form-bml-cursor-parse` 123 + `form-bml-cursor-lower` 113 + `form-bml-cursor-full` — each verdict native to the cursor across Go/Rust/TS/fkwu. The s-expr line compiler stays the routing default and is source-scan-bound (a 3-kernel proof by nature); the cursor's four-way standing is the proof surface, so the parity bands `form-bml-core-parity-band.fk` / `form-bml-cursor-parity-band.fk` are composted.

**The live default-flip — the self-hosting arc (the one real remaining blocker):**
Routing `form.bml` through the cursor *by default in the build* is NOT done, and must not be slammed: it would break the build today. Concrete prerequisites, in order:
- The cursor must cover the OTHER form.bml files the build compiles — notably `compiler.fk`, which uses `class`/`template`/`route` the cursor grammar does not yet parse. A global flip needs that coverage OR a per-file try-cursor-else-line route. (Breaths 4+.)
- The core.fk bootstrap cycle must be broken: the cursor depends on core.fk's functions, and core.fk is itself a form.bml file — so core.fk cannot compile *itself* through the cursor without a prior image. This is exactly the `.fkb` bootstrap-image ratchet (`BMF_BML_COMPILER_PICTURE.md`): line-compile core.fk → image → cursor re-compiles + verifies against it.
- A self-verifying route in `validate.sh` `prepare_sources` (compile via cursor, verify `node_eq` against the line compiler, fall back on mismatch) so the flip can never regress. NOT wired into the shared `fsc-compile-section-recipe` (that would risk every fkwu band that flattens source-compiler.fk).
- Then promote via the `.fkb` ratchet + floor audit before composting the released hand-scanner tissue.

**After core.fk:** repeat the arc for `source-compiler.fk`; and the separable kernel-ABI lift (Recipe/`.fkb` binary load path on all four arms) to retire the s-expr text wire.
