## Specs Implemented (Selected)

- 001–005 core API/pipeline foundations
- 007–014 platform baseline and safeguards
- 016–025 holdout/web/coherence/import capabilities
- 027–028 pipeline automation structure
- 030, 032, 034, 035, 037–044 hardening and status features

See [SPEC-COVERAGE.md](SPEC-COVERAGE.md) and [SPEC-TRACKING.md](SPEC-TRACKING.md) for full mapping.

## Active Priorities

1. Improve pipeline effectiveness and issue resolution loop.
2. Keep status/coverage artifacts in sync with shipped behavior.
3. Continue graph + coherence quality improvements through scoped specs.

## Validation Snapshot

- API endpoint set is available for health, tasks, projects, search, and import stack.
- Test suite remains the release gate.
- Overnight pipeline remains the main autonomous execution path.
