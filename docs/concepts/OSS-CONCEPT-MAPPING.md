# OSS Concept Mapping

How original Coherency Network concepts map to the Open Source Contribution Intelligence product.

| Original Concept | OSS Equivalent |
|------------------|----------------|
| Concept (CC004) | Repository, package, or significant module |
| Synergy Links (CC005) | Dependencies, imports, cross-project references |
| Synergy Node (CC007) | Contributor (developer, maintainer, reviewer) |
| Flow Events (CC003) | Commits, PRs, issues, releases, reviews |
| Energy Token (CC001) | Attribution credits / funding units |
| Coherence Score | Project health (see algorithm) |
| Harmony Agreements (CC002) | Contribution agreements, license terms |
| Collective Wisdom (CC008) | Maintainer decisions, RFC processes |
| Coherence Exchange (CC006) | Marketplace for funding, bounties, services |
| Concept Investment | Sponsoring / investing in projects or maintainers |

## Coherence Rewards (COH003) — OSS Interpretation

- Incentivizes contributions that improve project health
- Metrics: contributor diversity, activity cadence, documentation, responsiveness
- Distribution: proportional to coherence impact and downstream dependency
- Feedback: maintainers see score, improvement suggestions, attribution

## Pitfalls to Avoid (from concept docs)

- Balance different contribution types (code, docs, triage)
- Prevent gaming (fake commits, artificial inflation)
- Balance short-term metrics vs long-term sustainability
